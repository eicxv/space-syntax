## About Space Syntax

Space Syntax is a set of technique to analyse spatial relationships developed for urban planners and architects. One example of space syntax is to consider a street network of a city where every straight street segment is a node in a graph connected to other nodes. This network can then be analysed to yield insights about the network.
